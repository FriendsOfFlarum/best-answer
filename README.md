A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Mark a post as the best answer in a discussion. Original by @wiwatsrt. Requires `flarum/tags`

### Features
- Allow Best Answers to be set and highlighted within a discussion
- Set which tags support Best Answer/Q&A format
- Filter answered/unanswered/all discussions within available tags
- Send reminders to the OP to select a Best Answer after a configurable number of days
- Optionally allow the OP to select one of their own follow-up posts as the Best Answer
- Provides two layouts for the Best Answer controls
- Option to prevent reminders from being sent overnight

### Usage

Select which tags(s) you wish to enable for Best Answers to be set in using the `edit tags` feature of `flarum/tags`. These tags will then display `Ask a Question` in the start discussion button, rather than `Start a Discussion`. Optionally also select which tags(s) you wish to allow reminders to set Best Answers for.
